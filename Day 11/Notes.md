Strings in Python:
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).
Strings are used to store text data such as names, messages, addresses, etc.
Creating a string:
name = "Sumitha"
print(name)

Accessing characters:
print(name[0])  
print(name[-1])  

String length:
print(len(name))

String concatenation:
first = "Hello"
second = "World"
print(first + " " + second)

String repetition:
print("Hi " * 3)
