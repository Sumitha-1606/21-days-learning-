A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
In Python, there are mainly two types of loops:
1.for loop
2.while loop
3. Nested loop
For loop:
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence like numbers, lists, strings, or ranges.
Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
  statement
While loop:
A while loop executes as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
while condition:
  statement
Nested loops:
A loop inside another loop is called nested loop.
Loop control statements:
break:
stops the loop completely.
continue:
skips current iteration.
pass:
does nothing(placeholder).
