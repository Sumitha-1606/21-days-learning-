Polymorphism means:
Same method name, different behavior.
“Poly” → many
“Morphism” → forms
So one function behaves differently depending on object.
Polymorphism with Method Overriding

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Cat meows")

a = Animal()
d = Dog()
c = Cat()

a.sound()
d.sound()
c.sound()

Output
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
Cat meows
