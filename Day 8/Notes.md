Tuples in Python:
A tuple is a collection of items similar to a list but it is immutable (cannot be changed).
Tuples are ordered and allow duplicate values.
tuple_name = (item1, item2, item3)
Example:
numbers = (5, 10, 15)
print(numbers)
output:
(5,10,15)
Accessing elements:
numbers = (5,10,15)
print(numbers[0])
print(numbers[1])
output:
5
10
Tuple with different data types:
data = ("Sumitha", 10, True)
print(data)
output:
('Sumitha', 10, True)
length of the tuple:
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(len(numbers))
output:
4
Loop through tuple:
numbers = (5, 6, 7)
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
output
1
2
3
